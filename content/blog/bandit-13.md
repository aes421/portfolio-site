# Introduction

This post is part of a series walking through OverTheWire Bandit. You many want to start at the [beginning of the series]({{<ref "bandit-start">}}). The posts are my unedited, informal thought process while solving levels.

# Task

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
